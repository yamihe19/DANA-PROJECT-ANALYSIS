#1 Reading the table and see the first columns

```{r }
imdb_ds <-read.csv('../data/imdb_top_1000.csv', header = TRUE,  na.string = c(""))
head(imdb_ds)
```
# Looking the dimensions of the table
```{r}
dim(imdb_ds)
summary(imdb_ds)
```


# Looking the data type
```{r}
str(imdb_ds)
```

# Subsetting the variables.

```{r}
subset_imdb <- imdb_ds[, -c(1,8,9,11,12,13,14)]
subset_imdb
```
# Looking the dimensions of my subset of data set 
```{r}

dim(subset_imdb)
```

# Looking the variables with missing values 

```{r}
sum(is.na(subset_imdb))
summary(subset_imdb)
```

# Observing the data carefully

There is an error in the the column Released Year in the dataset and it is going to be replace with the value with more frecuency

```{r}
unique(subset_imdb$Released_Year)
```


```{r}
subset_imdb$Released_Year[subset_imdb$Released_Year == 'PG'] <- '1995'
unique(subset_imdb$Released_Year)
View(subset_imdb)
```

# How many movies are made per year (ranges) in the top 1000 IMDB? 

#Making the year as numerical variable

```{r}
Realesed_year_variable <- strtoi(subset_imdb$Released_Year)
```


#Generating the frecuency table for the variable
```{r}
min<- min(subset_imdb$Released_Year)
max<- max(subset_imdb$Released_Year)
ry_table <-table(cut(Realesed_year_variable, breaks = seq(min, max, by =8)))

total<- sum(ry_table)

ryear_pct<-round((ry_table/total*100),2)

cbind(Frequency= ry_table, Percentage =ryear_pct)
```

```{r}
pal <- colorRampPalette(colors = c("lightblue", "blue", 'yellow'))(12)
```


```{r}
barplot(ry_table, ylab = "Frequency", xlab = 'Released Year in Ranges', main = "MOVIES PER YEAR", col= pal, legend.text = rownames(ry_table),xlim= c(0, 22))
?barplot
```

#Conclusion:
The barplot clearly shows that the proportion of movies are higher in the right side. There are more than 100 movies in the 3 latest ranges.The tendecy is  to increase the latest movies in the IMDB rating 


---> Bivariate statements:

- What is the correlation between votes and IMDB rating? (Numerical variables: Number_of_votes and IMDB rating)

## Correlation analysis:

```{r}
plot(subset_imdb$No_of_Votes, subset_imdb$IMDB_Rating, xlab = 'Number of votes', ylab = 'IMDB Rating')
fit = lm(subset_imdb$IMDB_Rating ~ subset_imdb$No_of_Votes)
abline(fit)
```

```{r}
summary(subset_imdb$IMDB_Rating)
```


```{r}
cor(subset_imdb$No_of_Votes, subset_imdb$IMDB_Rating)
```

CONCLUSION: There is a positive low correlation between the variables, there are some outliers.
 
 
---> Test for the significance correlation to verify if this correlation applies to the population or just to the sample:

- Null hypothesis: The number of votes and the IMDB rating do not have linear correlation among all subjects in the population
- Alternative hypothesis: The number of votes and the IMDB rating have linear correlation among all subjects in the population

n = 1000
r = 0.4949
DP < 0.139

In this case r > DP, therefore, the x and y variable have positive linear relation among all subjects in the population so we have enough statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

## Regression analysis:

```{r}
summary(fit)
```

Formula: y = mx + b
           = 4.164(x)+7.835

## Verify: Intercept -> When one movie does not have audience votes, the intercept does not have meaning because the IMDB rating depends on the number of votes.
## verify: Slope -> When the number of votes varies X units, the movie is going to change 4.16 unites in the IMDB Rating.

## Validate the adequacy of the linear fit:

1. Linearity and Homoscedasticity conditions:

```{r}
plot(subset_imdb$No_of_Votes, fit$residuals, xlab = 'No of votes', ylab = 'Residuals')
abline(h = c(-0.4, 0, 0.6), col= c('blue', 'red', 'blue'), lty= c(2, 1, 2), lwd= c(3, 2, 3))
abline(h=0)
```


### Verify: We consider that the linear and homoscedaticity conditions are valid because the values are distribuited in the plot and they do not show any pattern.

2. Normal condition:

```{r}
hist(fit$residuals, xlab = 'Residuals')
```

## Verify: The normal condition is valid because the residuals follow a Normal Distribution despite being slightly skewed to the right.
